"""MCP tool registry (FastMCP edition).

Importing this package (or its submodules) registers all tools against the
shared `mcp_apple_reminders.server.mcp` FastMCP instance via the `@mcp.tool()`
decorators at module scope. FastMCP owns the registry directly — there is no
`ALL_TOOLS` / `ALL_HANDLERS` aggregation and no low-level `call_tool` dispatch.

Layout:
- `calendars.py` — calendar lifecycle + list/get/search tools.
- `reminders.py` — create/update/get/delete CRUD tools.
- `completion.py` — complete/uncomplete shortcuts.
- `queries.py` — filter/search/today/overdue/next/completed-range tools.
- `workflow.py` — Claude-* workflow-list move + lookup tools.
- `groups.py` — list-group (sidebar folder) tools.
- `alarms.py` — time/location alarm + recurrence tools.
- `bulk.py` — bulk create/complete/move/delete-completed tools.
- `sections.py` — subtask/parent/section tools.
- `smartlists.py` — custom smart-list create/update/delete + pin tools.
- `appearance.py` — list/group appearance + pinning tools.
- `templates.py` / `grocery.py` / `flags.py` — template, grocery, flag/extra tools.
- `agents.py` — agent-visibility bootstrap tool.
- `sampling.py` — sampling-backed triage tool.
